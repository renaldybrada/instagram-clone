## Instagram Clone

I've create an "encapsulated" instagram API before. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/renaldybrada/public-instagram-nodejs). Then I think that API was perfect for my next weekend project : **Instagram Clone**. This project using Vue.js bundled in webpack. You can visit this demo app [here](https://instagram-clone-2.herokuapp.com/)

## Key Features
1. Search insatgram posts by tags
2. Show instagram post details (like and comment included)
3. Show instagram profile
4. Automated Dark Mode :D

## Contribution, copyright and disclaimer
1. Pull Request are very welcome. 
2. Need to modify for your need? You are free to fork and do whatever you want **responsibly**
3. Those repositories, especially the **Instagram Public API** wasn't meant to violate Instagram Term Of Use. I recommended using this API for research purpose.
